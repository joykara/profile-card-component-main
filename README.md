### Continued development

I'd like to develop my knowledge in CSS to as I'm still not completely comfortable with techniques I found useful, such as Flexbox and CSS grid that I want to refine and perfect.


### Useful resources

- [CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me in learning more on Flexbox. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
